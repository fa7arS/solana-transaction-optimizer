## 🛠️ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd solana-lookup-table
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment setup**
   Create a `.env` file with your configuration:
   ```env
   SIGNER_KEY=your_base58_encoded_private_key
   ```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Required Environment Variables
- `SIGNER_KEY`: Your wallet's private key in base58 format

### Key Configuration Constants
The project uses several hardcoded addresses that you may need to update:

```typescript
// Main configuration in index.ts and other files
const lookup_address = new PublicKey("E4b5B9C3hapUZY7qfbLXTsPdaRzUT1HbT7uGRS19DXyL");
const program_id = new PublicKey("6EF8rrecthR5Dkzon8Nwu78hRvfCKubJ14M5uBEwF6P");
const mint = new PublicKey("9rwU5ex3PAp6TZ4PQ68nnGHtcRmnD5Hyo4QzYWZVpump");
const creator = new PublicKey("Gqd1HsMwhNMHtqL1iZ2M23DriBPJdnbJR8PEBUCPDvB");
```

### Multiple Buyers Setup
Edit `buyersKeys.ts` to add wallet private keys for bundle transactions:
```typescript
export const privateKeys = [
  "wallet1_private_key_base58",
  "wallet2_private_key_base58",
  // Add more wallets as needed
];
```

## 🚀 Usage

### 1. Single Buyer Comparison
Run the main comparison analysis:
```bash
npx ts-node single_buy_comparison.ts
```

This will:
- Create a normal transaction without lookup table
- Create the same transaction with lookup table
- Display detailed comparison metrics
- Show efficiency gains and recommendations

### 2. Bundle Transactions
Execute bundle purchases with multiple buyers:
```bash
npx ts-node bundle_buys.ts
```

### 3. Individual Functions
Run specific functions from `index.ts`:
```bash
npx ts-node index.ts
```

## 📊 Performance Analysis

## ⚠️ Important Considerations

### Security
- **Never commit private keys** to version control
- **Use environment variables** for sensitive data
- **Test on devnet** before mainnet deployment

### Network Considerations
- **Lookup table creation** requires ~15 seconds to activate
- **Account rent** costs for lookup table storage
- **Authority management** for table updates

### Limitations
- **Maximum 256 addresses** per lookup table
- **Immutable once created** (addresses cannot be removed)
- **Slot-based creation** timing requirements

## 🔧 Customization

### Adding New Account Types
To include additional accounts in your lookup table:

```typescript
// Add to the accounts array in your lookup table creation
accounts.push(
  new PublicKey("your_new_account_address"),
  // Add more accounts as needed
);
```

### Modifying Transaction Logic
Update the transaction creation logic in the respective files:
- `index.ts` for single buyer transactions
- `bundle_buys.ts` for multiple buyer transactions
- `single_buy_comparison.ts` for analysis functions

## 📈 Performance Tips

1. **Batch Operations**: Group related transactions to maximize lookup table efficiency
2. **Account Reuse**: Include frequently used accounts in lookup tables
3. **Monitor Usage**: Track lookup table effectiveness for your specific use case
4. **Optimize Timing**: Create lookup tables during low-traffic periods
5. **Bundle Strategy**: Use lookup tables for bundle transactions to avoid size limit failures
6. **Size Monitoring**: Track transaction sizes to identify optimization opportunities

### Real-World Impact
- **Bundle transactions** that previously failed (1536+ bytes) now succeed (871 bytes)
- **Single transactions** reduced from 660 to 353 bytes (46.5% reduction)
- **Network efficiency** improved through reduced bandwidth usage
- **User experience** enhanced with faster, more reliable transactions
